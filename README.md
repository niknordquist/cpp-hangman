# cpp-hangman
This program was written to solve an exercise on [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/chapter-16-summary-and-quiz/) <br/>
C++Man is a simple hangman trivia game that I programmed to improve my C++ skills. It is rather skeletal and primitive, but marks my first completed project in C++!
